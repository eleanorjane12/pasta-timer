## Welcome to Pasta Timer by Eleanor

I made this app as a small personal project using Electron and Node to sharpen my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, and to do something fun. 
Just start, input the time you want, and wait for your pasta to cook!

Here's a sneak peak at the UI, made entirely by me:
